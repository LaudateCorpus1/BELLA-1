## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you throught the utilization of the scripts we developed related to the main project, [BELLA](https://bitbucket.org/aydozz/longreads).

### Prerequisites

```
Text it
```

## Overlapping feasibility via Markov Chain Model

To run the script implementing the Markov Chain Model we developed to show the overlapping feasibility, do:

```
python exactMarkov.py
```
The default function setting is:
```python
func(overlap=500, p=0.85, k=17)
```
Explain this.
